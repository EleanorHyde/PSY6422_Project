# PSY6422_Project
Coursework for Data Analysis &amp; Visualisation 

## Counter-Strike Matches
A repo for my 2020 Data Analysis & Visualisation (PSY6422) coursework, as part of my MSc in Cognitive Neuroscience and Human Neuroimaging at the University of Sheffield.

## Data Origin
The dataset used in this project is titled **CS:GO Professional Matches**, published by Mateus Dauernheimer Machado on **Kaggle** (https://www.kaggle.com/mateusdmachado/csgo-professional-matches).
My analysis only considered *results.csv* which can be found in this github at *PSY6422_Project/results.csv*.
Future researchers may wish to consider the other csv files from this dataset, which can be found on Mateus' Kaggle page, such as *Players.csv, Economy.csv and Picks.csv*.

## Details
The project was written in **R script** using the following packages:
* tidyverse
* ggplot2
* cowplot
* data.table
* dplyr

## MSc Research Project
This analysis relates to my MSc dissertation: **Action video gamersâ€™ task switching and processing speed abilities: a mixed method investigation**. I may update this github with the experimental data and analysis from my dissertation in the future. For this project, I am supervised by Dr Claudia von Bastian.
